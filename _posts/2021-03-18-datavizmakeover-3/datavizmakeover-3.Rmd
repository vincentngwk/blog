### 1.1 Clarity

| S/N | Comments | Suggested Improvements |
|-----|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| C1 | Regarding the points plotted on the map visual, it is not clear if it represents the number of events, or the number of fatalities. | Indicate explicitly in the title of the map visual whether the data being visualized refers to number of events or fatalities. |
| C2 | The datapoints plotted on the map are of constant size, which does not provide much information on the scale or impact of the event. | Scale the size of the points by the value, whether it is the number of events or fatalities. |
| C3 | While the various line plots help to denote the trend across the years, users are not able to gauge the breakdown of the scale of various events in relation to each other. | To plot the various event types on a single plot. This allows users to have a sense of which events are major and minor contributors across the time period. |
| C4 |  The source of data and any references are not cited. | Include the citations and references at the bottom of the dashboard. |
| C5 | While the user is able to self-explore and find certain granular insights, there is a lack of 'big picture' statistics available to provide some context. | Include high-level key statistics based on the filters applied on the dashboard. |

### 1.2 Aesthetics

| S/N | Comments | Suggested Improvements |
|-----|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| A1 | For the various data points on the map, it is unclear if that specific event had any fatalities or not.  | Introduce point symbols, where a circle denotes an event without any fatalities, and a cross denotes the presence of fatalities for that recorded event. |
| A2 | There are no vertical gridlines present on the line plot. When more years are selected, this could make it tougher for the user to interpret the chart. | Add dotted vertical grid lines to aid the user in interpreting the chart, especially when making sense of the trend across many years. |


### 1.3 Interactivity

| S/N | Comments | Suggested Improvements |
|-----|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| I1 | Apart from some basic filters, the view is rather static. Users are unable to change the visualization based on other factors. | Include parameters and other filters for users to be able to play around and explore further. |
| I2 | Hovering over the various data points on both the map and line plots reveals only basic tooltips. Users are unable to get further meaningful information or context to drill further into. | Add graphs embedded into the tooltips when hovering over the various datapoints. |

# 3.0 - The final visualization
Using Tableau, design the proposed data visualization.




# 4.0 - Steps to create the visualization
Provide step-by-step description on how the data visualization was prepared.

### Part 1: Preparing the data and fields required

  + Drag the source data .csv file into tableau to import it in.

  + Create a parameter: Conflict Impact Type. This will allow us to toggle between showing Events, or Fatalities as data points on the visualizations.

</center>

  + Create calculated field: Event Count. This has a fixed value of 1.
  
  + Create calculated field: Selected Impact Type. This allows us to use it in conjunction with the previously created parameter.

  + Create calculated field: Number of Calendar Days. This provides us with the number of calendar days in the chosen number of years.
